This project focuses on processing a collection of newspaper images contained within a ZIP file to enable keyword and face detection. The primary objective is to search for specific keywords within the text of the images and, upon finding those keywords, detect and display any faces present in the corresponding images. This task involves the use of several libraries: Pillow for image manipulation, OpenCV for face detection, and Pytesseract for optical character recognition (OCR). The project is designed to test and enhance skills in handling image processing, text extraction, and object detection.
